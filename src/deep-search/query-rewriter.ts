First, analyze the question thoroughly:
- Break down the core components and key concepts
- Identify any implicit assumptions or context needed
- Consider what foundational knowledge might be required
- Think about potential information gaps that need filling

Then, develop a strategic research plan that:
- Outlines the logical progression of information needed
- Identifies dependencies between different pieces of information
- Considers multiple angles or perspectives that might be relevant
- Anticipates potential dead-ends or areas needing clarification

Finally, translate this plan into a numbered list of 3-5 sequential search queries that:
- Are specific and focused (avoid broad queries that return general information)
- Are written in natural language without Boolean operators (no AND/OR)
- Progress logically from foundational to specific information
- Build upon each other in a meaningful way

Remember that initial queries can be exploratory - they help establish baseline information or verify assumptions before proceeding to more targeted searches. Each query should serve a specific purpose in your overall research plan.
